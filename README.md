# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection
A machine learning-based system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions by analyzing transaction patterns and anomalies."
Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, addressing class 
imbalance with SMOTE. 
Utilized Logistic Regression and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. 
Evaluated the smodel using key metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and precision to balance detection 
and false positives. 
Provided actionable insights demonstrating the model's applicability to real-world fraud detection 
scenarios.
